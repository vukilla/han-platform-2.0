# Minimal deps to run GVHMR demo on Windows inside Isaac Sim Python.
#
# Important:
# - Do NOT pin torch/torchvision here. Isaac Sim / Isaac Lab ship their own CUDA builds.
# - PyTorch3D is installed separately by `scripts/windows/bootstrap_gvhmr.ps1` (from a community wheel index).
#   We still patch GVHMR to support `--skip_render` and provide a small `pytorch3d` stub so inference
#   can run even if the renderer is unavailable.
#
# If an install fails due to path length, move the repo to a short path:
#   C:\src\han-platform-2.0
